HackBio Genomics Final Project

Topic: Phylogenetic analysis of major covid-19 lineage genomes.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the world negatively, both medically and financially. In Nigeria, Johns Hopkins corona resource center has confirms 262,664 cases with 3,147 death. Next generation sequencing has been useful in understanding this disease. In this project, I applied Next Generation Sequencing techniques: Multiple Sequence Alignment and phylogeny analysis to compare samples from Nigeria with those from Italy, Russia, France, China, UK, and USA. I used NCBI virus sequence repository to search for sample and reference genomes, and MEGA 11 software to perform Multiple Sequence Alignment and construct a phylogeny tree. From this tree, I observed the relationship between collected samples and their mutation rates. This study confirms the claim by Johns Hopkins and will be useful to other scientists in future research on the nature, structure, and mutability of coronavirus.
